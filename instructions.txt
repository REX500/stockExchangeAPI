how to do a http request - u need to provide a link to it like this: http://www.google.com
if its a get http request: u write a ? at the end of it and then some data like param1=val1&param2=val2
get request can have as much as 2048 char's, not more, its not how many parameters its how many char's

Post request:
  the params are in the header of the request but not the link itself

  AJAX:
  the way to init it:
  $.ajax() - the idea is that u dont have to reload the page every time

  ajax call:
  it takes a jason
  $.ajax(){
  'url':'link for our assignment, smth like this: http://57.228.6/man2API/php/BankPhp.php',
  // here we specify the type of the req we want to use
  'type':'GET',
  'data':{
      'param1':'val1',
      'param2':'val2'
    }
  },
  'success':function(dataIn){
  ------
  --------
  -----the code to be run when we get the answer from the server/api
  --- string that looks like a json is the dataIn object we get back from the server
  -- to pars from the string JSON.pars(dataIn);
  -
  }


  ajax code will run in another thread, each ajax code u have will run in a other thread
  that means that  the part in success like a variable we cannot use it outside
  the 'success'
